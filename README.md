# project-1

   For this project, our group created a user-friendly webiste that dynamically displays the best deals for entertainment, dining and shopping. Our target market is teens & adults that are looking for a way to keep themselves entertained while saving money through our deals. The website meets all of the project requirements including the following:

1. Must use at least two server-side APIs.
2. Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
3. Use at least one new third-party API.
4. Must have a polished, mobile-first UI.
5. Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.).
6. Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals).
7. Must be deployed to GitHub Pages.
8. Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
